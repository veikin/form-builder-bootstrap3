<h3>About</h3>

<p>
Created By hongyangZhao (@<a href="https://github.com/zidaneaa">zidaneaa</a>) to help take the stress out of
writing all that markup to get bootstrap forms together. it has been written using <a href="backbonejs.org">backbone.js</a> and
takes advantage of <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">underscore.js templates</a>. In 26 Aug 2015,
  it has been rewritten using bootstrap3 and chinese language.

If you have a problem, or want a specific snippet added please check out the 
<a href="https://github.com/zidaneaa/">github project</a>. Note, this is only a simple tool so I'm not
that keen on adding many features (eg. saving/exporting forms, embedding forms etc.).
